# Configuring for other APIs
### Here be dragons...

This page will detail what chanegs need to be made to connect MateChat to other API providers.

This assumes that you have installed MelonLoader and MateChat, and that they are already running correctly.

## CloudFlare (Default model)
1. Create an account at [CloudFlare](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up)
2. Once you are logged into the CloudFlare dashboard:
    - Click on AI on the left hand menu
        - The click on Workers API.
    - Click on 'Use REST API' at the top of the screen.
    - Click Create a Workers AI API Token
        - This will pop a window open on the right. You can change the name of the token here.
        - Click Create API Token at the bottom.
        - Copy the API token that is created. This is the only time you will see the token.
        - Click Finish at the bottom.
    - The token that you just created will be added to the config file as the API_KEY.
    - Copy the Account ID. This will be added to the config file as the ACCOUNT_ID.
3. Click Back at the top of the screen. 
    - Select and copy the Model that you want to use. You will only need the part ater the slash
        - For example, CloudFlare's @cf/meta/llama-3-8b-instruct model, you would just need the llama-3-8b-instruct portion.
    - This will be added to the config file as MODEL_NAME.

## Once you have your API_KEY and ACCOUNT_ID
**Configure the Mod**
   - Start Desktop Mate
   - Right-click and select MateChat from the menu
   - Click "Open Config" and add your credentials:
     - `API_KEY` (. your API token)
     - `ACCOUNT_ID` (your account id. This is not needed for OpenAI )
   - Click "Reload Config"
   - ENGINE_TYPE is case sensitive. "Cloudflare", OpenRouter", and "OpenAI" are the correct formats.
   - If you are changing the ENGINE_TYPE, you may need to exit Desktop Mate completely and restart it after you have made your configuration changes.

```
[MateChat]
CHAT_KEYBIND = "F8"
ENGINE_TYPE = "Cloudflare"
ACCOUNT_ID = ""
API_KEY = ""
MODEL_NAME = "llama-3-8b-instruct"
